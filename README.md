# Challonge-MVP

This is the repo for a replit meant to update a title card AND leaderboard for an upcoming robot tournament.

The test board is located here: https://challonge.com/z57xc9 and the repl is here: https://replit.com/@TheMightyPong/Challonge-MVP?v=1

Use:
1: Make a board at challonge.com

2: Cut a hole in the box.

3: Update all the stuff at the start of main.py. (API Key, Username on Challonge and Tournament ID (AKA, the last part of the URL.

4: Throw away that box... it has a hole in it.

You may notice that it is currently ugly as hell. Make your own color choices. Then once you've made them, put them in the style.css folder in the /static directory.

Enjoy!
